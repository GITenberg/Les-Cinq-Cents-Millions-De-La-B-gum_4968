description: "The Begum's Fortune (French: Les Cinq cents millions de la Bégum), also\
  \ published as The Begum's Millions, is an 1879 novel by Jules Verne, with some\
  \ elements which could be described as utopian and others which seem clearly dystopian.\
  \ It is remarkable as the first published book in which Verne was cautionary and\
  \ to some degree pessimistic about the development of science and technology.\n\
  As came out long after the book's publication, it is actually based on a manuscript\
  \ by Paschal Grousset, a Corsican revolutionary who had participated in the Paris\
  \ Commune and was at the time living in exile in the USA and London. It was bought\
  \ by Pierre-Jules Hetzel, the publisher of most of Verne’s books. The attribution\
  \ of plot elements between Grousset's original text and Verne's work on it has not\
  \ been completely defined. Later, Verne worked similarly on two more books by Grousset\
  \ and published them under his name, before the revolutionary finally got a pardon\
  \ and was able to return to France and resume publication in his own name.\nThe\
  \ book first appeared in a hasty and poorly done English translation soon after\
  \ its publication in French – one of the bad translations which are considered to\
  \ have damaged Verne's reputation in the English-speaking world. W. H. G. Kingston\
  \ was near death and deeply in debt at the time. His wife, Mrs. A. K. Kingston,\
  \ who did the translation for him, was certainly otherwise preoccupied than with\
  \ the accuracy of the text and may have had to rely on outside help. in 2005 a new\
  \ translation from the French was made by Stanford L. Luce and published by Wesleyan\
  \ University.\nI. O. Evans in his introduction to his \"Fitzroy Edition\" of The\
  \ Begum's Fortune suggested a connection between the creation of artificial satellites\
  \ in this novel and the publication of The Brick Moon by Edward Everett Hale in\
  \ 1879.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
